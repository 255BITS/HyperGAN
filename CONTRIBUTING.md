# Project vision

The goal of this project is to create a composable GAN API to use in our own apps.

Our goal is to be able to train a model on expensive hardware, then deploy the generator or discriminator to various consumer platforms.

# Current state

There are backends to add, deployment targets to hit.  We could use help all across the stack.  If you are an ML engineer you can help by implementing a paper.  If you are an enthusiast, share your creations. And developers, we'd love to see what you create.

# Custom models

If you would like to contact us about building custom models please email martyn.garcia AT gmail.com.

HyperGAN is a long-term project by 255 BITS.
