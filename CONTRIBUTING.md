Thank you for contributing.  There are many ways to get involved:

* Implement a paper.  There is a huge list of GANs left to implement: https://github.com/GKalliatakis/Delving-deep-into-GANs
* Create an API example.  Warning, this is _very_ fun.
* Contribute a screenshot or video of your trained network.
* Do your own custom research.
* Search for good GAN configurations on your hardware (examples are searchable)

GANs are so very interesting and we welcome anyone wanting to help explore them.

# Project vision

The goal of this project is to create a composable GAN API for developers, researchers and artists to use.

### Developer goals:

We foresee developers training models on expensive hardware, then deploying a generator or discriminator to various platforms(phones, tablets, servers, toasters (the perfect toast robot?)).  

HyperGAN hopes to make that *easy* to do with the API.

### Artist goals:

Artists may use GANs to generate paintings, align concepts to data, or things we cant think of (they are very creative people).  

HyperGAN can help artists by being *simple* to use through the command line.

### Researcher goals:

Researchers may find it useful to compose various parts of different papers to test concepts or add new composable types.  

HyperGAN can help researchers a *sharable* way using `json` files.

# Current state

HyperGAN is in open beta and available to everyone under the MIT license.

# Custom models

If you would like to contact us about building custom models please email martyn.garcia AT gmail.com.

HyperGAN is a long-term project by 255 BITS.
