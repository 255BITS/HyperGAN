# Thank you for contributing!

There are many places where we would love help:

* Implement a paper.  There is a huge list of GANs left to implement: https://github.com/GKalliatakis/Delving-deep-into-GANs
* Create an API example.  Warning: this can be fun.
* Contribute a screenshot, _gif_ or video of your trained network.
* Search for and _share_ good GAN configurations (examples are searchable)
* Do your own custom research.  Warning: this is addictive.

GANs are very interesting and we welcome and encourage anyone wanting to explore them.

## Requesting a feature

Open an issue describing the feature and a little bit about why you want it.  Include a link to a paper if applicable. 

## Adding a feature

Wow you rock - simply send a pull request!  Any work contributed will be under the MIT license so everyone can share in the results.

## Filing a bug

Create a new issue.  Please try to keep your titles short and describe how to reproduce the problem if applicable.

## Sharing a network or samples

Create a pull request.  Warning: there is a file size github limit on gifs. 

## Adding documentation

Thank you!  Issue a pull request

## Project vision

The goal of this project is to create a composable GAN API for developers, researchers and artists to use.

### Developer goals:

We foresee developers training models on expensive hardware, then deploying a generator or discriminator to various platforms(phones, tablets, servers, smart toasters).  

HyperGAN hopes to make that *easy* to do with the API.

### Artist goals:

Artists may use GANs to generate paintings, align datasets, or things we cant think of (they are very creative people).  

HyperGAN can help artists by being *simple* to use through the command line.

### Researcher goals:

Researchers may find it useful to compose various parts of different papers to test concepts or add new composable types.  

HyperGAN can help researchers by being *sharable* (and reproducable) using `json` configurations.

## Current state

HyperGAN is in open beta and available to everyone under the MIT license.

GANs are an active area of research and things will likely shift to best accomodate the state of the art.

## Custom models

If you would like to contact us about building custom models please email martyn.garcia AT gmail.com.
