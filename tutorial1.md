# Hypergan tutorial 1

First install hypergan.

You can run:

```
  hypergan train -c online256 -s 256x256x3 /mydata -format png --sampler static_batch
```

To see if hypergan is working properly.

You can acquire a dataset by having a folder full of loose images.  400 is the minimum amount of images, and more are recommended.
