## 0.8 ~ Least Squares GAN and API examples

* Tensorflow 1.0 support
* New configuration format and refactored api.
* New loss based on least squared GAN.  See <a href="#Least-Squares-GAN">least squares GAN implementation</a>.
* API example `2d-test` - tests a trainer/encoder/loss combination against a known distribution.
* API example `2d-measure` - measure and report the above test by randomly combining options.
* Updated default configuration.

## 0.7 ~ WGAN & API

* New loss `wgan`
* Initial Public API Release
* API example: `colorizer` - re-colorize an image!
* API example: `inpainter` - remove a section of an image and have your GAN repaint it
* API example: `super-resolution` - zoom in and enhance.  We've caught the bad guy!
